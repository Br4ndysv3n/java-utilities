# java-utilities

Utility classes for better handling of Java code. Take a look at the tests on how to handle the methods. Maybe the most of the methods can be implemented as real extension methods in the future, known from C#.

### Installation

Just run mvn clean package to build the library. It can be used as OSGi bundle. See MANIFEST.MF for exported packages and change bnd.bnd if necessary.
